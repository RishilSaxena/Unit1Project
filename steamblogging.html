      <p>
        This is a blog that my family and I started together. We write about all
        sorts of topics, and I in particular have wrote a couple about my
        experiences. One was about my piano experience, and I had one about my
        programming journey. My parents wrote about other things, from something
        as simple as selecting a blogging platform to the meaning of life.
