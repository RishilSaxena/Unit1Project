          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hi! I'm Rishil Saxena. I'm a 14 year old boy that's interested in
            the latest technology. My goal is to open my own company one day,
            and I'm especially interested in software, robotics, and physics. I
            really enjoy coding and am really interested in my course that I am
            taking to be a full stack web developer. Soon, I'll be able to build
            my own fully functional websites all by myself! I'm really excited
            about that.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h1>My Inspirations</h1>
          <p>
            I'm inspired by the people that are unafraid to try new things and
            by doing so, become the people that create the coolest, newest
            technology. I'm talking about people like Elon Musk who do things
            that seem impossible. Take, for example, the electric car. No one
            thought that it would be remotely possible, but he didn't care. He
            went for it and look where he is now. One day, I want to become like
            one of those people who start a company that seems impossible but
            turns into something awesome. Whether that be in software or
            something else, I want to become a leader in new technology.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <h1>My Goals</h1>
          <p>
            When I grow up, as I told you, I'd like to open my own company. But,
            I'm not sure which field I'm going to be in yet. Both software and
            science are both interesting to me. I enjoy both of them and I still
            need time to decide which field to go in. But for now, I'm going to
            be doing a lot of software because it's easy for me to do on my own.
            I'm hoping to create a cool product that I could actually try and
            market!

          <h3>Things I enjoy:</h3>
          <h5>Robotics!</h5>
          <p>
            I enjoy working with Lego Mindstorms, Arduino, and other robots! My
            favorite part about robotics is programming them to do what I want.
            I participated in a Lego Mindstorms competition in 5th grade. I also
            enjoy using Arduino. It runs on a basic microcomputer, and you can
            connect different components to create basic circuits and robots.

          <br />
          <h5>Coding!</h5>
          <p>
            Coding is something I truly enjoy. I like working on projects, and
            I'm currently in the coolest web development camp. I have to say,
            this is one of the best camps I have ever been to, and I'm learning
            so much. But, of course, that's all because I have a great teacher.
            I'm excited to put my skills to work after the camp and working with
            local businesses to create products for them!
